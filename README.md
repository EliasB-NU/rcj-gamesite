# RCJ Gamesites

Fetches the all the games and standings from the Soccersys software by Marco Dankel and displays the game plan
on the gameplan site, the standings on a site and all the games for each referee on another site.

# Config
There is a config.js file, where you can select your tournament.  
If I have the time, I maybe will do it with the URL.
